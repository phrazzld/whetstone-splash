# TODO.md - Whetstone Landing Page Optimization

## Critical Path: Performance & Asset Optimization

### Image Pipeline [BLOCKING]
- [x] Audit app-icon-02.png (3.2MB) - determine if needed, else delete. File: `assets/images/app-icon-02.png`
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Searched codebase: no references to app-icon-02.png in HTML/CSS
  - File was unused, taking 3.2MB of space
  - Deleted to reduce repo size (saved 3.2MB)
  - Keeping app-icon.png (1.5MB) for favicon generation
  ```
- [x] Compress app-icon.png (1.5MB) to <200KB using pngquant with `--quality=65-80` flag. Target: 85% size reduction minimum
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Installed pngquant via homebrew
  - Compressed app-icon.png from 1.5MB to 152KB
  - Achieved 90% size reduction (exceeded 85% target)
  - Quality preserved with --quality=65-80 flag
  ```
- [x] Generate favicon set from app-icon.png: 16x16, 32x32, apple-touch-icon 180x180. Use sharp or imagemagick with bicubic resampling
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Used ImageMagick v7 with Lanczos filter (better than bicubic for downsampling)
  - Generated favicon-16x16.png (4KB), favicon-32x32.png (4KB), apple-touch-icon.png (16KB)
  - Added favicon links to index.html <head> section
  - Icons placed in assets/ directory for clean organization
  ```
- [x] Create responsive srcset for hero section: 320w, 768w, 1024w, 1440w WebP variants of app icon. Max 50KB per variant
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Created WebP variants using ImageMagick + cwebp
  - app-icon-320w.webp: 8KB (q=85)
  - app-icon-768w.webp: 20KB (q=85)  
  - app-icon-1024w.webp: 32KB (q=85)
  - app-icon-1440w.webp: 40KB (q=75, reduced quality to meet 50KB limit)
  - All variants under 50KB target with good visual quality
  ```
- [x] Implement `<link rel="preload" as="image" type="image/webp">` for hero image in index.html `<head>` section
  ```
  Work Log:
  - Added preload link for 768w WebP variant (20KB)
  - Chose 768w as optimal default size for most viewports
  - Placed after favicons, before stylesheet for proper loading order
  - Will improve LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) metric
  ```

### Meta & SEO Foundation [P0]

  - Emphasized key features: reading progress, notes, sync
  - Highlighted free and private aspects for competitive advantage
  - Mentions Apple devices for platform targeting
  ```
