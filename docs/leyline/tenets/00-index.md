| ID | Version | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [adaptability-and-reversibility](./adaptability-and-reversibility.md) | 0.2.0 | Requirements evolve, technologies advance, and contexts shift. The most successful software systems embrace this reality and design for adaptation ... |
| [automation](./automation.md) | 0.2.0 | Automation respects the scarcity of human attention and creativity. Let machines handle consistent, reliable execution of well-defined processes, f... |
| [build-trust-through-collaboration](./build-trust-through-collaboration.md) | 0.2.0 | Your team is your most valuable asset, more than any single piece of technology, architecture, or process. A team that trusts each other can adapt ... |
| [content-addressable-history](./content-addressable-history.md) | 0.2.0 | Git's power stems from its elegant foundation: every piece of content (blobs, trees, commits) is identified by a SHA-1 hash of its contents, creati... |
| [deliver-value-continuously](./deliver-value-continuously.md) | 0.2.0 | This tenet connects the "how" of our development (our other principles) to the "why" (business and user value). It frames our work not as a series ... |
| [design-is-never-done](./design-is-never-done.md) | 0.2.0 | Software design is an iterative discovery process, not a one-time decision. The best design emerges through continuous refinement as you learn more... |
| [distributed-first](./distributed-first.md) | 0.2.0 | Git's distributed architecture isn't a feature—it's the foundation that enables everything else. Unlike centralized version control where the serve... |
| [distributed-git-workflows](./distributed-git-workflows.md) | 0.2.0 | Git is fundamentally a distributed system, and thinking about it through this lens transforms how we approach version control at scale. Just as dis... |
| [distributed-resilience](./distributed-resilience.md) | 0.2.0 | Git was built on a fundamental insight: centralized systems create single points of failure that cripple developer productivity. When your ability ... |
| [document-decisions](./document-decisions.md) | 0.2.0 | Future developers approaching your code are like archaeologists examining ancient artifacts. They can observe what was built, but without documenta... |
| [dry-dont-repeat-yourself](./dry-dont-repeat-yourself.md) | 0.2.0 | DRY is about knowledge management and maintaining consistency. When the same knowledge exists in multiple locations, you create a maintenance burde... |
| [empathize-with-your-user](./empathize-with-your-user.md) | 0.2.0 | Think of the difference between an architect and a construction worker. Both are skilled professionals, but an architect must understand how people... |
| [explicit-over-implicit](./explicit-over-implicit.md) | 0.2.0 | Every implicit assumption in your code is cognitive debt waiting to be paid. When behavior is hidden behind magic methods, global state, or clever ... |
| [fix-broken-windows](./fix-broken-windows.md) | 0.2.0 | Just as a broken window in a building signals neglect and invites further vandalism, unfixed bugs, TODO comments, suppressed warnings, and quality ... |
| [git-least-surprise](./git-least-surprise.md) | 0.2.0 | The principle of least surprise, fundamental to Ruby's design philosophy, applies powerfully to version control. When Git behaves predictably and i... |
| [git-reliability-engineering](./git-reliability-engineering.md) | 0.2.0 | Version control is the backbone of software development, yet we rarely apply the same reliability engineering rigor to Git that we apply to product... |
| [git-workflow-conventions](./git-workflow-conventions.md) | 0.2.0 | Git is an incredibly powerful tool, but that power comes with complexity. The number of possible workflows, branching strategies, and collaboration... |
| [humble-confidence](./humble-confidence.md) | 0.2.0 | Software development is fundamentally about managing complexity in the face of incomplete knowledge. Yet our industry often rewards the appearance ... |
| [joyful-version-control](./joyful-version-control.md) | 0.2.0 | Git, at its core, is a tool for humans to collaborate on creative work. When we design version control workflows that align with human nature rathe... |
| [maintainability](./maintainability.md) | 0.2.0 | Most of a software project's lifetime is spent in maintenance mode. The code you write today will be read, modified, and debugged dozens of times i... |
| [modularity](./modularity.md) | 0.2.0 | Modularity is the fundamental approach for taming complexity. Design your code as well-defined, independent components that humans can comprehend a... |
| [no-secret-suppression](./no-secret-suppression.md) | 0.2.0 | Quality tools serve as vigilant guardians of your codebase, continuously scanning for patterns that experience has shown to be problematic. When th... |
| [observability](./observability.md) | 0.2.0 | Modern distributed systems are too complex for humans to understand through intuition or guesswork. When something goes wrong, you need your system... |
| [orthogonality](./orthogonality.md) | 0.2.0 | Orthogonality is about isolation and independence—ensuring that unrelated components in |
| [product-value-first](./product-value-first.md) | 0.2.0 | Code is not an end in itself—it's a means to deliver value to users. When you write code, you're not just creating instructions for computers; you'... |
| [simplicity](./simplicity.md) | 0.2.0 | Simplicity is a fundamental requirement for maintainable software. Simple code is easier to understand, debug, and extend when requirements change. |
| [testability](./testability.md) | 0.2.0 | Testability isn't something you add after writing code—it's a fundamental design constraint that shapes how you structure systems from the beginnin... |
